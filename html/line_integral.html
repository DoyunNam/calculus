    <!-- Line Integral -->

      <h1>Line Integral</h1>
      <p>
        A line integral (also known as a path integral) is an integral where the
        function to be integrated is evaluated along a curve. The curve is
        defined by a parametrization, and the integral sums up the function
        values along this curve. There are two main types of line integrals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scalar Line Integrals</strong>: Integrate a scalar function
          along a curve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vector Line Integrals</strong>: Integrate a vector field along
          a curve.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Scalar Line Integral</h2>
      <p>
        The scalar line integral of a function \( f \) over a curve \( C \)
        parametrized by \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) from \( t = a \) to \( t = b \) is
        given by:
      </p>
      <p>
        \[ \int_C f(\mathbf{r}) \, ds = \int_a^b f(\mathbf{r}(t))
        \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| \, dt \]
      </p>

      <h2>Vector Line Integral</h2>
      <p>
        The vector line integral of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) along a
        curve \( C \) is given by:
      </p>
      <p>
        \[ \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_a^b
        \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t)) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) \, dt \]
      </p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <h3>Example 1: Scalar Line Integral</h3>
      <p>
        Consider the function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) and the curve \( C \)
        which is the unit circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) parametrized by \(
        \mathbf{r}(t) = (\cos t, \sin t) \) for \( t \) in \([0, 2\pi]\). The
        scalar line integral is:
      </p>
      <p>
        \[ \int_C (x^2 + y^2) \, ds = \int_0^{2\pi} (\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t)
        \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| \, dt = \int_0^{2\pi} 1 \cdot 1 \, dt = 2\pi \]
      </p>

      <h3>Example 2: Vector Line Integral</h3>
      <p>
        Consider the vector field \( \mathbf{F}(x, y) = (y, -x) \) and the curve
        \( C \) which is the unit circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) parametrized by \(
        \mathbf{r}(t) = (\cos t, \sin t) \) for \( t \) in \([0, 2\pi]\). The
        vector line integral is:
      </p>
      <p>
        \[ \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_0^{2\pi} ( \sin t, -\cos
        t) \cdot (-\sin t, \cos t) \, dt = \int_0^{2\pi} ( -\sin^2 t - \cos^2 t)
        \, dt = \int_0^{2\pi} -1 \, dt = -2\pi \]
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Physical Meaning of Line Integral -->
    <div>
      <h1>Physical Meaning of Line Integral</h1>
      <p>
        A line integral is a type of integral where a function is evaluated
        along a curve. It generalizes the concept of integrating over an
        interval to integrating over a curve or path in space. The physical
        meaning of a line integral depends on the context and the function being
        integrated.
      </p>
      <h2>Example 1: Work Done by a Force Field</h2>
      <p>
        In physics, one common use of line integrals is to calculate the work
        done by a force field \( \mathbf{F} \) on a particle moving along a path
        \( C \). The work \( W \) is given by the line integral:
      </p>
      <p>\[ W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} \]</p>
      <p>
        Here, \( \mathbf{F} \) is the force field, \( d\mathbf{r} \) is a
        differential element of the path \( C \), and \( \mathbf{F} \cdot
        d\mathbf{r} \) represents the dot product of the force vector and the
        displacement vector. This integral sums up the work done by the force
        along each infinitesimal segment of the path.
      </p>
      <h2>Example 2: Circulation of a Vector Field</h2>
      <p>
        Another application of line integrals is in fluid dynamics, where it is
        used to compute the circulation of a vector field \( \mathbf{V} \)
        around a closed curve \( C \). The circulation \( \Gamma \) is given by:
      </p>
      <p>\[ \Gamma = \oint_C \mathbf{V} \cdot d\mathbf{r} \]</p>
      <p>
        Here, \( \mathbf{V} \) is the velocity field of the fluid, and the
        integral sums the dot product of the velocity and the path's tangent
        vector around the closed curve, representing the total circulation
        around the curve.
      </p>
      <h2>Example 3: Flux Across a Curve</h2>
      <p>
        Line integrals can also be used to calculate the flux of a vector field
        \( \mathbf{F} \) across a curve \( C \). The flux \( \Phi \) is given
        by:
      </p>
      <p>\[ \Phi = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, ds \]</p>
      <p>
        In this case, \( \mathbf{n} \) is the unit normal vector to the curve \(
        C \), and \( ds \) is a differential element of the arc length. This
        integral measures how much of the field \( \mathbf{F} \) passes through
        the curve \( C \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Line integrals are powerful tools in various fields of science and
        engineering, providing a way to sum quantities along curves in space.
